Introduction: You have been invited to participate in a research study conducted by Dr. Scott Martin from Brigham Young University - Idaho’s psychology department. The purpose of this study is to learn more about individuals’ decisions and perspectives in a variety of scenarios. This survey is best if taken on a computer/laptop, not on a mobile phone, as some question formats may not display correctly.


Procedures: Your participation will take approximately 5 minutes. This survey is purely for academic purposes, which means that we do not conduct this study on behalf of private companies. PLEASE NOTE: This study contains a number of checks to make sure that participants are finishing the tasks honestly and completely. As long as you read the instructions and complete the tasks, your answers will be adequate for full credit of project completion.


Risks/Discomforts: We do not anticipate any risk from participating in this study. While no risk is expected, there could be unforeseen consequences. However, we do not expect these to be any greater than daily living.


Benefits: Some students may be compensated with class credit by their teachers. However, the primary benefit of this study is to assist researchers in advancing their understanding of social interaction.


Confidentiality: All personal information (telephone numbers, email addresses, etc.) will remain private. Your information will not be sold to a third party, but will only be used by research project staff to contact you for scheduling. In addition, your study responses will remain anonymous. This means that your personally identifiable information will not be displayed with your study responses; study data will not be identifiable to a specific person. Your identifiable information will be kept in a password protected electronic file separate from your questionnaire responses, accessible only to research study staff.


Participation: Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. You have the right to withdraw at any time or refuse to participate entirely without jeopardy to your class status, grade, or standing with the university. You agree that you will give your full effort while participating and will refrain from talking about this study to your friends and colleagues until the study has been completed.


Questions about the research: If you have questions about this research project or would like to inquire about the results of the study, please contact Dr. Martin at BYU-Idaho. Office: Rigby 361 Phone: 208-496-4086 email: martinsc@byui.edu Questions about your rights as a research participant: If you have additional questions regarding your rights as a participant in research projects, you may contact Susan Ward, Associate Dean of Faculty Development, 172B MCK, BYU-Idaho, Rexburg, Idaho 83460-0430; (208) 496-2400; email, wards@byui.edu.
